## 1 What is SHADOW

SHADOW is an open source ray tracing code for modeling optical systems. 

Targeted to synchrotron radiation beamlines, it has unique features for 
designing X-ray optical systems. 

For more info, please read this paper (open access):

SHADOW3: a new version of the synchrotron X-ray optics modelling package
M. Sanchez del Rio, N. Canestrari, F. Jiang and F. Cerrina
Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Volume 18, Part 5 (September 2011)
http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0909049511026306

If you are (or want to be) a SHADOW user, it is recommended that you use
a user interface. We strongly recommend OASYS (https://www.elettra.eu/oasys.html).

## 4 Building SHADOW
  binary:
  ```
  cd src
  # Check (edit) the Makefile if you need to redefine compilers etc.
  # The use of Makefile is documented in its header. Basically:
  make           : builds shadow3 the main program
  make all       : builds shadow3, libraries, etc
  make install   : installation (see Makefile)
  ```

  python API:
  
  in shadow3 directory, use the standard python setup:
  
  ```
  python3 setup.py build
  pip install .
  ```

## 5 Other info
  For python users, some wheels are available:
  - in the official http://pypi.org:
    ```
    pip install shadow3
    ```
  - in the http://ftp.esrf.eu/pub/scisoft/shadow3/wheels directory. 
  - Other documents, mostly obsolete, can be found at https://github.com/srio/shadow3-docs
