## 1 What is SHADOW

SHADOW is an open source ray tracing code for modeling optical systems. 

Targeted to synchrotron radiation beamlines, it has unique features for 
designing X-ray optical systems. 

For more info, please read this paper (open access):
- M. Sanchez del Rio, N. Canestrari, F. Jiang and F. Cerrina
"SHADOW3: a new version of the synchrotron X-ray optics modelling package" Journal of Synchrotron Radiation Volume 18, Part 5 (September 2011)
http://dx.doi.org/10.1107/S0909049511026306

If you are (or want to be) a SHADOW user, it is recommended that you use
a user interface. We strongly recommend OASYS (https://www.aps.anl.gov/Science/Scientific-Software/OASYS) with its ShadowOui add-on.

## 2 Installing SHADOW


In most cases, shadow3 is used within the OASYS package, therefore there is no need to install it independently (install OASYS from https://www.aps.anl.gov/Science/Scientific-Software/OASYS ). 

To install shadow3 in python, you can use pip or conda:
- https://pypi.org/project/shadow3/
- https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/shadow3


## 3 Building SHADOW


SHADOW3 sources are downloaded using git: 

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/oasys-kit/shadow3
  ```
  
  To build the command-mode shadow3 version: 
  ```
  cd shadow3/src
  # Check (edit) the Makefile if you need to redefine compilers etc.
  # The use of Makefile is documented in its header. Basically:
  make           : builds shadow3 the main program
  make all       : builds shadow3, libraries, etc
  ```

  to build the python API:
  
  in shadow3 directory, use the standard python setup (see comments in setup.py for specific platforms):
  ```
  python setup.py sdist build
  python setup.py bdist_wheel
  python -m pip install dist/...whl
   ```
